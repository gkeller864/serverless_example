- This is a rough draft. The private and public api's will need to be adjusted to work properly. They need to be point resources correctly
- This structure is so that many more resources can be added to this environment and it can easily be set up for Terraform Cloud to target different directories.
- The assumed roles give to the Lambda and API gateway are using assumed. If there is a problem with communication, more than likely that is the first place to look.
